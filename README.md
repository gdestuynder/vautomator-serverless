# vautomator-serverless
Repository to experiment with serverless framework and automation.

This project uses serverless framework and attempts to create a serverless environment that could be used to automate vulnerability assessment tasks from multiple ingestion points, such as on-demand submission of a host via a REST API, regular scanning of a known list of hosts, and opportunistically scanning of hosts appearing in Certificate Transparency logs.

This is under development with more features being added as different branches. The current branch supports:
- Addition of a target to the scan queue for port scan by an API endpoint (`/ondemand/portscan`). Due to the intrusive nature of this endpoint, it is protected by an API key.
- Addition of a target to the scan queue for HTTP Observatory scan by an API endpoint (`/ondemand/httpobservatory`)
- Addition of a target to the scan queue for TLS Observatory scan by an API endpoint (`/ondemand/tlsobservatory`)
- Addition of a target to the scan queue for SSH Observatory scan by an API endpoint (`/ondemand/sshobservatory`)
- Performing requested scan type (port, HTTP Observatory,  TLS Observatory or SSH Observatory) on hosts in the queue
- Scheduled port scans from a hard-coded list of hosts (for PoC purposes, currently disabled)
- Scheduled HTTP Observatory scans from a hard-coded list of hosts (for PoC purposes, runs once a day)
- Scheduled TLS Observatory scans from a hard-coded list of hosts (for PoC purposes, runs once a day)
- Scheduled SSH Observatory scans from a hard-coded list of hosts (for PoC purposes, runs once a day)
- Manually add a host to the scan queue (for PoC purposes).

Results from all scans are placed in an S3 bucket specified in `serverless.yml`.

Port scans are performed using a [statically compiled `nmap` binary](https://github.com/ernw/static-toolbox/releases/download/1.0.2/nmap-7.70SVN-b5bd185-x86_64-portable.zip), [packaged within the serverless application](https://github.com/mozilla/vautomator-serverless/blob/ondemand-port-scan/serverless.yml#L41-L43).

_**Note:** UDP port scans are not supported as Lamdba functions can not be as root/privileged users._

## Get ready to deploy

1. Install serverless framework: `npm install -g serverless`
2. Install `serverless-python-requirements` plugin for serverless: `npm install --save serverless-python-requirements`
3. Download the repo: `git clone https://github.com/mozilla/vautomator-serverless.git && cd vautomator-serverless`
4. Setup your AWS environment/profile. An account or role with at least the permissions listed in [serverless.yml](https://github.com/mozilla/vautomator-serverless/blob/master/serverless.yml#L10-L33) is required in order to deploy and run this.
5. Customise your `serverless.yml` file, in particular the `custom` section where you can specify your own S3 bucket name/SQS name etc.
6. Once your AWS profile is set up, run: `serverless deploy -v`
7. If you have no CloudFormation errors and if you see `Service Information` listing your lambda functions/endpoints, you are good to go.

## Running

- Scheduled Observatory scans will run once a day: `serverless logs -f cronHttpObservatoryScan`
